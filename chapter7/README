# Clojure for the Brave and True: Chapter 7 Exercises

Chapter 7 introduced the concept of macros and discussed how Clojure reads data structures of code and sends them to the evaluator.

## The Exercises

1. Use the list function, quoting, and read-string to create a list that, when evaluated, prints your first name and your favorite sci-fi movie.
2. Create an infix function that takes a list like (1 + 3 * 4 - 5) and transforms it into the lists that Clojure needs in order to correctly evaluate the expression using operator precedence rules.
