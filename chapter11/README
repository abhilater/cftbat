# Clojure for the Brave and True: Chapter 11 Exercises

There were no exercises printed for Chapter 11, but core.async being such an important and useful library, I couldn't not do some form of exercise. I chose to re-implement the random quote word count function from Chapter 10 in core.async rather than using futures and promises. Interestingly, if the count of random-quotes to get is increased by too much, the server responds with 503, so we should really throttle our accesses to the server somehow.
